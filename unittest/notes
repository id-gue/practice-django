			assertTrue(x)
			assertIsNot(a, b)
			assertIsInstance(a, b)

python syntax: __underscores__

_single_leading_underscore  (weak 'internal use' indicator, 
							can not be imported by from M import X)

single_trailing_unterscore_ (convention to avoid conflicts 
							with Python keyword)

__double_leading_underscore (naming class attributes)

__double_leading_and_traiding_underscore__ ('magic' objects or 
							attributes that live in user-contolled name-spaces)
